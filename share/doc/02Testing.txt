### Testing

If you open a command window and go to your `MQL4\Python` directory
run this command first
`
python OTMql427/PikaListener.py "#"
`
Then open another command window and go to your `MQL4\Python` directory
run this command second
`
python OTMql427/PikaChart.py "foo"
`
You should soon see `['foo']` appear 10 times in the first window.

If it does not work, then solve this problem first, because it
won't work from Python under Mt4 if it doesn't work here.

If you leave the first command running, you should see the tick
and bar information broadcast by the calls in `OnTimer` and `OnTick` in
`MQL4/Experts/OTMql4/OTPyTestPikaEA.mq4`

`OnTimer` is called every iTIMER_INTERVAL_SEC (10 sec.)
which allows us to use Python to look for Pika inbound messages (not yet),
or execute a stack of calls from Python to us in Metatrader.
