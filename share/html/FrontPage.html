<h2>OTMql4AMQP - AMQP bindings for MQL4 Python</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4AMQP/">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4AMQP/</a></p>

<p>This project allows the OpenTrading Metatrader-Python bridge<br />
(https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Py/)<br />
to work with RabbitMQ, or probably any version of AMQP,<br />
a high performance enterprise messaging prtotcol<br />
for asynchronous communications between applications.<br />
It builds on OTMql4Py, and requires it as a pre-requisite.</p>

<p>In your Python, you must have installed Pika:<br />
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pika/">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pika/</a><br />
Pika offers the advantage of being pure Python: no DLLs to compile<br />
or install. Pika communicates with AMQP servers, the most common<br />
open-source one being RabbitMQ.</p>

<p>You will also need an AMQP server installed, configured and running<br />
to use this project, which can be a challenge under Windows; see<br />
<a href="http://www.rabbitmq.org.">http://www.rabbitmq.org.</a> The code assumes the default server setup<br />
of username: guest, password: guest, virtual host: /. For a brokerless<br />
messaging protocol that does not require installing a server, see<br />
our ZeroMQ bridge, <a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/</a></p>

<p><strong>This is a work in progress - a developers' pre-release version.</strong></p>

<p>It works on builds &gt; 6xx, but the documentation of the wiring up<br />
of an asnychronous event loop under Python still needs to be done,<br />
as well as more tests and testing on different versions.<br />
Only Python 2.7.x is supported.</p>

<p>The project wiki should be open for editing by anyone logged into GitHub:<br />
**Please report any system it works or doesn't work on in the wiki:<br />
include the Metatrader build number, the origin of the metatrader exe,<br />
the Windows version, and the AMQP server version and version of the Pika.**<br />
This code is known to run under Linux Wine (1.7.x), so this project<br />
bridges Metatrader to RabbitMQ under Linux.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>For the moment there is no installer: just <tt>git clone</tt> or download the<br />
zip from github.com and unzip into an empty directory. Then recursively copy<br />
the folder MQL4 over the MQL4 folder of your Metatrader installation. It will<br />
not overwrite any Mt4 system files; if it overwrites any OTMql4Py files,<br />
the files are in fact identical (e.g. <tt>__init__.py</tt>). See<br />
<a href="Installation">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader/wiki/Installation</a> .</p>

<p>Attach the<br />
<a href="OTPyTestPikaEA.mq4">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4AMQP/raw/master/MQL4/Experts/OTMql4/OTPyTestPikaEA.mq4</a><br />
EA to a chart and make sure it's working; look at the Experts log in Mt4<br />
to see messages of success.</p>

<p>Look at the <tt>OnTick}} and {{{OnTimer</tt> functions of <tt>OTPyTestPikaEA.mq4</tt><br />
to see how the EA works to send and receive messages from<br />

<p>Please file any bugs in the <br />
<a href="issue tracker">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4AMQP/issues</a> .</p>

<p>Use the Wiki to start topics for discussion:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4AMQP/wiki/Home">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4AMQP/wiki/Home</a><br />
It's better to use the wiki for knowledge capture, and then we can pull<br />
the important pages back into the documentation in the share/doc directory.<br />
You will need to be signed into github.com to see or edit in the wiki.</p>

<p>You may want to also look at:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader</a><br />
which provides a command-line interpreter to speak to an OTMql4AMQP<br />
enabled Metatrader.</p>
