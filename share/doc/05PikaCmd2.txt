## PikaCmd2.py

This script can be run from the command line to send commands
to a OTMql4Pika enabled Metatrader. It will start a command loop to
listen, send commands, or query the RabbitMQ management interface, based 
on the cmd2 REPL: see cmd2plus.py in https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Lib

Type help at the command prompt to get more help.

Call the script with --help to see the script options.

The normal usage is:

sub topics timer.# retval.# - to subscribe to a message queue of events
sub run                     - to start a thread listening for messages
pub cmd AccountBalance      - to send a command to OTMql4Pika,
                              the return will be a retval message on the listener

### chart

Set and query the chart used for messages to and from RabbitMQ:
  list   - all the charts the listener has heard of,
           iff you have already started a listener with "sub run"
  get    - get the default chart to be published or subscribed to.
  set ID - set the default chart ID to be published or subscribed to.
  set    - set the default chart to be the last chart the listener has heard of,
           iff you have already started a listener with "sub run"
  add    - NOTImplemented
  remove - NOTImplemented

The chart ID will look something like: oChart_EURGBP_240_93ACD6A2_1

### sub
Subscribe to messages from RabbitMQ on a given topic:
  sub topics TOPIC1 ... - subscribes to topics.
  sub show              - shows topics subscribed to.
  sub run               - start a thread to listen for messages.
  sub stop              - start a thread to listen for messages.
  sub clear             - clear the list of subscribed topics NOTImplemented.

Common topics are: # for all messages, tick.# for ticks,
timer.# for timer events, retval.# for return values.
You can choose as specific chart with syntax like:
    tick.oChart.EURGBP.240.93ACD6A2.#

### pub
Publish a message via RabbitMQ to a given chart on a OTMql4Py enabled terminal:
  pub cmd  COMMAND|ARG1|... - publish a Mql command to Mt4,
      the command should be a single string, with | seperating from arguments.
  pub eval COMMAND|ARG1|... - publish a Python command to the OTMql4Py,
      the command should be a single string, with | seperating from arguments.

### rabbit
If we have pyrabbit installed, and iff the rabbitmq_management plugin
has been installed in your server, we can introspect some useful
information if the HTTP interface is enabled. Commands include:
    get vhost_names
    get channels
    get connections
    get queues

### Messaging Format

The messaging to and from OTMql4Py is still being done with a
very simple format:
      sMsgType|sChartId|sIgnored|sMark|sPayload
where sMsgType is one of: cmd eval (outgoing), timer tick retval (incoming);
      sChartId is the Mt4 chart sChartId the message is to or from;
      sMark is a simple floating point timestamp, with milliseconds;
and   sPayload is command|arg1|arg2... (outgoing) or type|value (incoming),
      where type is one of: bool int double string json.
This breaks if the sPayload args or value contain a | -
we will probably replace this with json or pickled serialization, or kombu.
