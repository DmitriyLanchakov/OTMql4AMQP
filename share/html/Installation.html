<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Install from Source</h3>

<p>Alernatively, you can just "git clone" or download the zip from github.com<br />
and unzip into an empty directory. Then recursively copy the folder<br />
<tt>MQL4</tt> over the <tt>MQL4</tt> folder of your personal <tt>AppData...</tt> directory<br />
(something like<br />
<tt>c:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\MetaQuotes\Terminal\LONGHEXNANE</tt>).<br />
It will not overwrite any system files, and keeps its files in subdirectories<br />
called <tt>OTMql4</tt>.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>This project requires the prior installation of our<br />
MQL4 trading library: <a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Lib.">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Lib.</a><br />
Again, <tt>git clone</tt> this from <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a> and recursively copy<br />
it's folder MQL4 over the MQL4 folder of your personal Metatrader directory.</p>

<p>This project requires the prior installation of our MQL4<br />
Python bridge: <a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Py.">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Py.</a><br />
Again, <tt>git clone</tt> this from <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a> and recursively copy<br />
it's folder MQL4 over the MQL4 folder of your Metatrader installation.</p>

<p>One day we'll make an installer, but for now, you must install the three<br />
projects manually, and if you update the code via <tt>git pull</tt>, be<br />
sure to update all three, as they are usually checked in together.</p></body>
