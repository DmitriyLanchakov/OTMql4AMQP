### OTMql4AMQP - AMQP bindings for MQL4 Python
https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4OTMql4AMQP/

This project allows the OpenTrading Metatrader-Python bridge
(https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Py/)
to work with RabbitMQ, or probably any version of AMQP,
the emerging standard for high performance enterprise messaging,
for asynchronous communications between financial and trading applications.
It builds on OTMql4Py, and requires it as a pre-requisite.

In your Python, you must have installed Pika:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pika/
Pika offers the advantage of being pure Python: no DLLs to compile
or install. Pika communicates with AMQP servers, the most common
open-source one being RabbitMQ http://www.rabbitmq.com
You will need an AMPQ server installed, configured and running
to use this project.

**This is a work in progress - a developers' pre-release version.**

It works on builds > 6xx, but the documentation of the wiring up
of an asnychronous event loop under Python still needs to be done,
as well as more tests and testing on different versions.
Only Python 2.7.x is supported.

The project wiki should be open for editing by anyone logged into GitHub:
**Please report any system it works or doesn't work on in the wiki:
include the Metatrader build number, the origin of the metatrader exe,
the Windows version, and the AMQP server version and version of the Pika.**
This code in known to run under Linux Wine (1.7.x), so this project
bridges Metatrader to RabbitMQ under Linux.

### Installation

For the moment there is no installer: just "git clone" or download the
zip from github.com and unzip into an empty directory. Then recursively copy
the folder MQL4 over the MQL4 folder of your Metatrader installation. It will
not overwrite any Mt4 system files; if it overwrites any OTMql4Py files,
the files are in fact identical (e.g. __init__.py).

Use the Wiki to start topics for discussion:
https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4OTMql4AMQP/wiki
It's better to use the wiki for knowledge capture, and then we can pull
the important pages back into the documentation in the share/doc directory.
You will need to be signed into github.com to see or edit in the wiki.
