    Wired up the return channel so that Mt4 can receive commands over RabbitMQ.

Date:   Fri May 1 17:39:26 2015 +0300

    Made an EA that is now working and broadcasting ticks and bars.
    Needs cleaning up with regard to queues and topics, but it's working.
    
    Started playing with callme as a return RPC command channel.
    You'll need to install callme and its prereqs first.
    Could be a whole lot of fun...
