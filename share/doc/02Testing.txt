### Testing

If you open a command window and go to your `MQL4\Python` directory
run this command first
`
python OTMql427/PikaListener.py "#"
`
Then open another command window and go to your `MQL4\Python` directory
run this command second
`
python OTMql427/PikaChart.py "foo"
`
You should soon see `['foo']` appear 10 times in the first window.

If it does not work, then solve this problem first, because it
won't work from Python under Mt4 if it doesn't work here.
