<h2>Round Tripping</h2>

<p>Mt4 can call Python, but Python can't call Mt4. So we need to<br />
establish a round-trip from Mt4 that looks to see if there is anything<br />
that Python wants it to do.</p>

<p>The way we do this is to make a Queue object from the Python library<br />
<tt>Queue</tt> and push anything Python wants done onto the Queue in Python.<br />
Then put a timer event in your Mt4 expert that fires periodically<br />
(like even 10 seconds), and calls the Python code to pop the work<br />
off the queue.</p>

<p>However, Mt4 does not have an eval command to handle arbitrary strings<br />
to be executed. So we wrote the <tt>zOTLibProcessCmd</tt>` in the OTMql4Lib<br />
project (OTLibProcessCmd.mq4)<br />
that approximates what should be Eval in Mt4.</p>

<p>Depending on how you push things onto the queue, you may want to<br />
take the result of <tt>zOTLibProcessCmd</tt> and distribute it via RabbitMQ.</p>
