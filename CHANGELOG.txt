    Made an EA that is now working and broadcasting ticks and bars.
    Needs cleaning up with regard to queues and topics, but it's working.
    
    Started playing with callme as a return RPC command channel.
    You'll need to install callme and its prereqs first.
    Could be a whole lot of fun...
