### Test Expert

There is a test expert advisor in
`Experts/OTMql4/OTPyTestPikaEA.mq4`

Then you open a command window and go to your `MQL4\Python` directory
run the following command to see the messages the expert is broadcasting:
`
python OTMql427/PikaListener.py "#"
`
You can select which RabbitMQ messages you want to subscribe to from
one or more of `ticks` `bars` timer` `retval`
to see just ticks, do
`
python OTMql427/PikaListener.py "tick.#"
`
To see timer events and ticks, do
`
python OTMql427/PikaListener.py "tick.#" "timer.#"
`
Read the RabbitMQ document for further details of using `#` and `*`
to select the messages you are interested in; you can select by
type of message, the currency pair, period, the hex value of the `ChartID`.

The interval for timer events can be set when you attach the expert:
`
extern int iTIMER_INTERVAL_SEC = 10;
`

The information that is put on a tick is supplied by the function
`sBarInfo` which puts together the information you want send
to a remote client on every bar. Change it to suit your own needs:
`
#include <OTMql4/OTBarInfo.mqh>
`

You can have many experts running on many charts. There is only one
`Pika.connection.Connection` object, and it is shared by all charts.
The total number of charts using the connection is kept in the global variable
`fPY_PIKA_CONNECTION_USERS`. When the last expert is removed, this
number drops to 0, and the Connection is shut down.

You should always remove any `OTMql4Py` experts before you shut down Mt4.
It may not initialize properly if you start Mt4 with an `OTMql4Py`
expert already attached. You may have to remove the expert and restart
Mt4 if it does not initialize properly.

Specifically, if you load an `OTMql4Py` expert and the Mt4 log shows
a message about `exceptions.SystemError`, it means that the Python
DLL did not load properly, and you *must* restart if you want to use
an `OTMql4Py` expert. You should get a pop-up Alert from Mt4 to alert
you of this.
